        Almost slipped up, but I'm back! Hello future children and current
        readers and yada yada yada! I am currently on my morning commute to
        school, so I have about 10 minutes or so to write. Then I walk around 15
        or so minutes to school. I should tell the children how treacherous the
        walks were, Haha!<br>
        Anyways, life has actually been pretty good! I got a scholarship in the
        beginning of February, so that is awesome. I got over 120,000 points in
        CyberStart America, so I was luckily considered, was able to apply, and
        was accepted! Now, I am taking a virtual course to get a GFACT
        certification which is a game changer, really, really happy for that! I
        understand most of the concepts in the course, so I imagine the
        certification exam won't be too difficult. Right now, I am considered a
        national cyber scholar by NCSF (National Cyber School Foundation), but
        if I pass the exam and get certified, I would be a national cyber
        scholar with honors (which means more potential scholarships or
        internships)! I think that is really cool, and I am hoping to
        pass the exam. My deadline is on June, so be sure to check back by
        then!<br><br>
        Anyways, that's about the highlight of my year so far! I'm very excited
        to see how things go (ah, and my dual credit class I just remembered.
        Don't think I ever mentioned it.. Next thought I will...)! I probably
        have aorund 5 minutes to spare now, but I really need to quickly host
        this locally to make sure it all works, then update it on the server.
        Speaking of! Really sweet stuff! Love the server! OKAY BYE CHILDREN BYE
        READERS I'LL MAKE AN UPDATE NOT NEXT YEAR
