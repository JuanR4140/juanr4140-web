      <p>
        I first saw you in 8th grade. At first, we didn't interact very much. I had just moved in, 
        and so I was getting used to being in a new environment. By 9th grade, however, I noticed
        you were outside in the mornings smoking your cigarette. It started with a nod, to acknowledge 
        each other's existence, then it turned into a wave. Every morning, whenever I'd leave the house
        to school, you'd always be there. And I'd wave at you, and you'd wave at me. It went on every morning, 
        sometimes even during the weekend while going out. By 10th grade, I like to think we got closer. 
        If I was outside and saw you around, I'd go and talk to you. We had good talks. When the October 2023
        solar eclipse came around, I got an extra pair of eclipse glasses for you. While mom was on the other 
        side of the street looking at the sun with her glasses, I came to you and handed you a pair and watched it with you. 
        Oh, What I wouldn't give to go back to those 20 minutes. We continued our daily waving tradition, and 
        you even gave me Christmas presents which I really, really appreciated! However, it was after you gave me 
        the presents that I didn't see you again. For two months. I thought it had gotten too cold for you to step out in 
        the mornings. Imagine my surprise and devastation when I saw the ambulance outside your home. It turns out you had been 
        at the hospital for those two months. You decided to spend your days at your own home, and so they dropped you off. Seeing you in that 
        state, I didn't know how to feel. I felt dreadful, pessimstic, nervous, and afraid. Needless to say, I never saw you 
        outside on your porch after that day ever again. I visited you two times during the next month. On that first visit, 
        I felt anguish. How could this great man, who had the energy to be on the porch every morning to wave at me, suddenly 
        become so weak that it hurt to move in his own bed? Talking to you brought a wave of relief, to an extent, knowing you were well. 
        On the second visit, that changed. You slept. Were you sleeping? Or were you just too tired to do anything other than breathe?
        I came running as soon as your wife called and suggested we visited. I'm glad I did. I thought you had months to live, maybe weeks.
        I didn't expect that it was instead one night. I heard the news from your wife the following morning. I'm glad I visited. 
        Life is unexpected. I mean, come on, I was hoping to invite you to my high-school graduation! I hope, at least, you get a good view from 
        up there in Heaven. Sometimes, I wish you would've told me what was going on, although I understand why you wouldn't. It's a 
        horrible concept to accept. And, quite honestly, I wish you would've listened to your wife and quit those damn cigarettes. 
        
        <br><br>
        Thank you for everything, Mike.
        <br><br>
        Your friend, Juan.
