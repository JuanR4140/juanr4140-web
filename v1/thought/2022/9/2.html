      <h1>Juan Meets Music</h1>
      <h2>2022-9-2</h2>

      <hr>
      <p>Procrastinating Juan here. I am drowing in homework!! I have
      one or two assignments from Geometry and the first one is closing off at
      4PM! So, I guess I'll get a 73% on that. I underestimated just how much
      work we'd get. I also have reading homework that's due today. And AP Human Geography.
      Life is good. :). Anyways, that's not the point of this Thought. I thought it'd be nice to
      tell how I discovered music and how it's going. At least something fun to type about while
      school ends. We get a 3 day weekend yay..<br>
      I've always been fascinated with music ever since I was a little kid. Though
      very dumb as I only ever listened to Sonic the Hedghehog soundtracks. Specifically
      Sonic 1 and 2. I would sit down and just listen to the tracks as if they were
      normal songs. I was probably about 6-8. The first change in my music journey was when I 
      was around 9 or 10, as I started to listen more of Legend of Zelda tracks. Haha nothing
      different, just a different game. <br>The genuine breakthough came when I was 11 or 12.
      I had a girlfriend who's initials I'll refer to K.C. She was very much into older
      bands and if I recall correctly, loved The Beatles, KISS, and The Rolling Stones.
      Keep a note of The Beatles, as they will be a legitimate crucial part of my life. 
      She had been telling me to listen to The Beatles for a while now, and while I refused since
      I didn't want to stop listening to video game tracks, I, at last, gave in. 
      I was playing "Doomspire Brickbattle" on Roblox, and my dad had bought YouTube Premium, which
      included YouTube music. I decided to search up The Beatles as I was curious and
      came across "Hey Jude". I reluctantly clicked on it, and listened. I wouldn't
      say it was "love at first hearing", but it was very close. I fell in love with the
      "Naaaaa, Naaa, Naaa, Na Na Na Na"'s at the end and listened to some more songs. It took a bit,
      but I now had a small collection of songs I liked from The Beatles. My girlfriend and I weren't together
      at that point, but over the next months, I'd find myself listening to The Beatles more and more
      and more! It took a little over a year and a half until I realized they had albums, and it took 2 or 3 to finally
      listen to all of them and like them! I only listen to The Beatles now, soo thank you ex girlfriend
      for introducing them to me haha. The Beatles were the ones who got me to actually want to make music,
      and so I've been playing small amounts of piano. You can listen to "Long Ago" - Demo #2 at

      Wellp, that's pretty much where I am now. Huge Beatles lover and novice piano player.
      Thanks to them though, I now greatly appreciate music. :) and I DONT LISTEN TO VIDEO GAME TRACKS
      ANYMORE WHAT WAS WRONG WITH ME??!.</p>
