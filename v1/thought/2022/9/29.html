      <p>Woah. It's been almost a month now? That's pretty crazy. Time flies. Hello again
      and welcome back to another Thought post. I have plans for the website, and have begun
      to add some of my ideas, like the navigation bar. I am planning on removing the buttons on
      the home page, and replacing them with quick access links maybe. (Like latest Thought post).
      What will I talk about today, you ask? Well.. not much really. I don't have much to talk
      about anyways. Well, maybe school. School is actually.. fun. There's a lot of pretty nice
      people in here, so I'm glad that if I'm spending 4 years with students, it's going to be
      with these people. I don't know though, I have high hopes. I'm trying to do well in school, I want to
      get into a decent college with a computer science degree to get a job somewhere. I heard computer
      science pays well, so I'm excited for that. What I'm not excited for is adult life. The thing is, when 
      I was a child, I always thought things magically happened. Like the clothes washed and folded themselves.
      Or that the food made itself. The truth is that it doesn't, obviously, and it was my parents the entire time.
      I feel pretty scared then to be kept up with so many possibilities as an adult, like bills, connections, jobs, 
      washing clothes, cooking, staying alive. It's all too much I think, but that's life, isn't it? I'm sure I'll 
      be fine.<br><br>In other news, last Monday was crazy! Jupiter was the nearest to the Earth since 1963, or 59 years! 
      I adore space a lot, I always get fascinated talking/reading/discussing about it. I was outside Monday night looking up
      it was mesmerizing! I took this picture on my phone:</p>
      <img height="250" width="250" src="media/jupiter.jpg"></img>
      <p>and this was a TikTok livestream someone was doing from their telescope:</p>
      <img height="500" width="250" src="media/tiktokj.jpg"></img>
      <p><br><br>School is great though, life is good. I uploaded some things to <a href="../../../page/projects" style="color: white;">JuanR4140/Projects</a> though!
      I'm mainly working on a melody on my guitar, also added a table of contents since I expect to fill more of it with
      more projects.<br><br>Anyways, that's it from me! See you.. next month....</p>
