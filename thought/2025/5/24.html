                    <p>HEY GUYS what is UP today in this Thought post we're going to be discussing LAPTOPS!!!! If you've read my previous Thought posts you might've come across a Thought talking about getting a new laptop for the GFACT test. This laptop was an HP Stream 14. It had 4GB RAM, 64GB eMMC, and a horrible Intel Celeron N4020. Now, this laptop could barely handle Windows 11. It ran egregiously slow, and I ended up nuking it and replacing it with Void Linux! I daily drove it for about a year now, and actually, the awesome cool Tech guy at school upgrade the RAM from 4GB to 8GB, giving the system more breathing room! Sadly, hardware issues were apparent, and the screen started artifacting at the slightest movement and the system would freeze. It was time to get a new, actually decent, laptop HAHA!! SO looking through laptops with Mr Awesome Cool Tech Guy, I finally landed on the Latitude 5420. This system has 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD, and an Intel i5-11th gen! An enormous upgrade!!!! SO i ordered it, took like 3 weeks to get here, and IM FINALLY ON IT. Coolest thing though; and another part where Mr Awesome Cool Tech Guy jumps in, the laptop that came had some hinge issue that seemed worrying at first. It would require a repair. HOWEVER it turns out he actually had a spare laptop at school, same model and everything, and was able to swap the hinge, well effectively the screen, and now there are no more glaring issues with it. The screen replaced is even a touch screen, too! He also upgrade the RAM from 16GB 2660Mhz to 32GB 3200Mhz!! SO I owe my entire life to Awesome Cool Tech Guy!! <br>Overall, I'm really happy with this upgrade, the jump from a Celeron, 8GB RAM, 64GB eMMC to an i5 11th gen, 32GB RAM, 256GB SSD is.. insane. I'm looking forward to upgrading the SSD to 512GB sometime, but I'm really happy. So, thank you very very very very very very very very very very very very very VERY much to Mr. Ramirez for going out of his way to help me out throughout the year, giving me pointers in the field of technology, and things to look out for IN EVERY ASPECT OF EVERYTHING.<br>He's not going to be at school next year, and next year I will be a senior, but I'll always remember Mr. Ramirez, Mr. Cardoza, and Ms. Spicer for helping advance my knowledge in computer science and cybersecurity! Mr. Cardoza and Ms. Spicer coordinated to buy me the Latitude E6420 that I first used Linux on, Mr. Ramirez ignited my curiosity in hardware and helped me buy the perfect laptop. Without them, I wouldn't be as knowledgeable on computers as I am now. Thank you very much!!!</p>
