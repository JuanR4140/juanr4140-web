                    <p>Ever since the days of juanr4140.u8.lc Thoughts had been a thing! They continued through juanr4140.com and continue to be a dreadful thing I do sometimes ! But why do I dread it? Why is it so annoying having to do these thoughts, and why do I take AGES to even upload one? I'LL TELL YOU WHY! It's not as simple as typing in a text box and clicking an "upload" button! How I wish I had that all these years. Instead, I had to copy an older thought, replace the fields, push it to the repo and pull it on the server! What a pain in the butt, no? Finally, I sat down this weekend and made a Python script that took care of all of that for me! I'm currently typing this out on my terminal, and whenever I'm done, it will automatically push the changes locally, log in to my server, and pull the changes from there, therefore streamlining the process and making everything much quicker! Expect monthly thoughts now, weekly thoughts now, hell, even daily thoughts!<br>Or not! Maybe the every-6-months-thought tradition lives on!</p>
