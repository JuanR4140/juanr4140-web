                    <p>it's been a while.<br><br>Honestly, life has been a really weird thing for me for the last couple
                    months, or since i last posted on here. i mean, i'm a junior now! i'll keep this thought short, i 
                    just wanted to let you know i wasn't.. dead or anything. anyways, i've been really getting into the
                    smashing pumpkins, which is strange, because for the last 5 or so years, i've literally only listened
                    to the beatles. i've been listening to the sp's discography: gish, siamese dream, melancholy, adore,
                    machina, even their newest releases like cyr and atum! anyways; i've been feeling pretty lonely recently,
                    having an existential crisis, that sort of thing, you know? it's been making me really demotivated, to
                    the point where i stopped posting on here altogether! but i'm not going to bore you with those details,
                    after all, why would i 'vent' on my own website? crazy, right? anyways; i'm kind of forcing myself to write 
                    this, and hopefully i keep posting and don't disappear for another year. i'm still very much going through
                    this episode though, so we'll see. i'm trying to keep myself distracted by redesigning the page and getting
                    a new pfp in. school is ok. it's not great. life is ok. it's not great. i have nothing to be sad about, 
                    but i guess i have nothing to be happy about either. it's a weird feeling. anyways; i hope i'm able to 
                    come back feeling a little better in february, but we'll see. until next time! and of course..
                    <br><br>happy new year!</p>
