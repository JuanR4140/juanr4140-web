      <p>
        HELLOOO and welcome to ANOTHER episode of JUAN'S THOUGHTS! Welcome children (wow, I really am leaning a lot
	towards that gimmick huh??) and current readers!! What am I think about today, March 13th, 2024???<br>
	I'm pretty excited, actually! I took the practice GFACT certification exam and got a 94%, so naturally, I
	immediately scheduled a proctor to take the real one. I'll be taking it on March 16th, 2024, 4:50PM CTD, or, 
	this Saturday! I actually get 2 hours on this exam, but I finished the practice one in about 30 minutes. I hope
	it doesn't seem suspicious to the proctor...<br>
	Anyways! Some bad news... the practice exam went great, but the real exam has to be taken in a secure test 
	browser. Unfortunately, this test browser is only available for Windows and Mac users. I'm a Linux user!!!!
	I was greatly insulted and offended. I tried running the browser through Wine, but alas, it failed. This
	upset my mother a lot actually. When I first got my laptop 2 years ago in 8th grade, it had Windows on it. 
	However, a year ago, about September or October of 9th grade, I put Void Linux on it! It was fine and dandy, 
	my mother didn't care. But now that I have to take this test and don't have a Windows machine, I had to
	convince my mother to let me dumpster dive for a new laptop :(. Fortunately, I didn't have to and I was able to
	snatch a laptop for cheap although with pretty low specs. Runs okay though, enough to test! Really grateful.<br>
	Matter of fact, I've been writing this entire thing in Windows! Or, erm, Linux. WSL, actually. Windows Subsystem
	for Linux! It was so hard setting it up, turns out I had to install the WSL2 kernel because I had WSL1
	installed. How did I find that out? By Googling an error message. Wow, Microsoft, very cool...... <br><br>

	Anyways!!!!!!!!!! My test is still set for this Saturday, so wish me luck! I'll definitely add a new entry with
	my results. I just want to get it over with so I don't have to worry about it during school (speaking of, I am
	on spring break!). WELL, I've been yap yap yapppinn' for too long. SO, I'll leave it at that!<br><br>
	TLDR: Mom hates Linux because I needed a Windows program and I don't use Windows, also taking GFACT exam this 
	Saturday<br><br>

	THANK you reader for reading this and not keeping me alone with my thoughts:) GOOD EVENING READERS AND
	CHIDREN!!! Goooodddbyeee!!!!!!!!!!!
